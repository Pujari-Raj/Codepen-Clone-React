### Note
* The reason of not hosting this web app is due to the conflicts of the dependency of codemirror that it doesn't support react version >17 and mui doesn't support version <16.
* Due to this reasons unfortunately i wasn't able to host this application.(PS: I tried debugging for this issues but at the end I couldn't host it.), but you can try hands on experience of this app by just making a clone of this repository and npm i command.
